# RLanguageTwitterTextMining -> Files and README Coming Soon

## Project
**Text Mining and Feeling Analysis**

- Data will be collected using the twitteR package in RStudio (5000 tweets minimum).

- Objectives: 
    (1) Clean the tweets. 
    (2) Provide a list of the 15 most frequent words and pairs of words with the highest co-occurrence frequency. 
    (3) Create a graph representing the most frequent words with their polarity, the most frequent co-occurences with their polarity, indicate and compare the 3 most frequent representatives in each category to give an overall study polarity.
